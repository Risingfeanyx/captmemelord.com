<ul>
	<li>Four years of A+ related Windows repair</li>
	<li>Started working with GNU/Linux based systems in 2012, hopped around Ubuntu, then Manjaro, then back 
to Mint.</li>
	<li>Jailbroke a handful of iOS devices between iOS 4 and iOS 7. That&#39;s more in the script kiddie 
dept, but it&#39;s worth noting. Marked my first intro into the whole &quot;break it, then fix it&quot; 
mentality of learning. Really helped narrow down my experience working with Unix-esque filesystems.</li>
	<li>Worked at a certain Automatic-Paper-Clipping related store in their ET dept from 2014-2018. 
Doesn&#39;t give me any tech-related points, but gives me some solid Customer Service and +5 to my 
<strong><strike>jaded</strike></strong> customer service stats.</li>
	<li>Helped around a good bit during the <a 
href="http://www.chip-community.org/index.php/Main_Page"style="color:black;
target="_blank">Pocketchip</a> heyday. Pretty slick having a handheld GNU/Linux terminal, but unfortunately, 
crowdfunding by its nature is a gamble.</li>
	<li>Fooled around with a handful of different flashcards for the Nintendo <a

href="https://www.ezflash.cn/product/ez-flash-iv/">GBA (SP)</a> , and of course CFW on the ol&#39; <a 
href="http://wololo.net/cfw4dummies/" target="_blank">PSP 3K</a> and <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/" 
target="_blank"> 3DS</a>.</li>
	<li>Just finished reading the <a 
href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/GNU/Linux+Essentials%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119092148/" target="_blank">Wiley 
GNU/Linux Essentials </a>, currently in the middle of the <a 
href="comptia.html" target="_blank">Comptia+ 
Security+ book</a></li>
	<li>1 year (so far!) of working within a cPanel/LAMP stack environment at a snazzy web hosting 
company. Involved in (read: gave feedback) on internal documentation, along with scrapping together some <a 
href="https://captmemelord.com/functions">functions</a>  to 
make my job alot easier.</li>
	<li>Decided to put together my docs(s) in one site. Makes <strike> humble-bragging 
</strike> sharing<a href="books.html"target="_blank">docs</a> easier

        <li>Dipped my toes in a few quick music videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61nG8p8SgbI&t"target="_blank">here</a> and  <a href="https://youtu.be/FxdY0OGdBx0"target="_blank">here</a>
	<li>One-and-off porting the <a href="https://www.studiotrophis.com/site/projects/thewhitechamber"target="_blank">The White Chamber</a> to <a href="https://github.com/Risingfeanyx/white_chamber_cli"target="_blank">Bash</a>

	<h1><strong>Less is More</strong></h1>
	Consider the following:

	<p .25px="" style="">With the rise of Windows 10&#39;s rolling release cycle, machines in a 
professional, or perhaps life-dependent environment are rendered useless, little more then a glorified 
Etch-a-Sketch</p>
	*nix documentation is so excessive, it&#39;s <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#Command_usage/" target="blank">built</a> into the OS. Since any 
server worth it&#39;s silicon runs GNU/Linux, even Azure servers, anything you perfect locally will apply 
everywhere

	<p .25px="" style="">Windows cripples its users, the only reason it exists are three: <a 
href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="blank_">existing</a> support for AAA games, it comes preinstalled on 
most machines and Enterprise contracts.</p>
	For many companies, it&#39;s easier to pay for a windows license knowing it&#39;ll come with support, 
and that&#39;s where many fail; poor management would rather give their people fish instead of teaching them how 
to fish</li>
</ul>
<em>&quot;Sharing is good, and with digital technology, sharing is easy. I could have made money this way, and 
perhaps amused myself writing code. But I knew that at the end of my career, I would look back on years of 
building walls to divide people, and feel I had spent my life making the world a worse 
place.&quot;&nbsp;</em>
